# Tool Reference for KINETI X

## Build and Runtime Tools

- `Vite` — the development server and build tool
- `npm` / `npx` — implied package manager for installing dependencies and running scripts
- `React` — UI library for the app
- `React DOM` — React renderer for the browser

## Styling

- `Tailwind CSS` — utility-first CSS framework
- `@tailwindcss/vite` — Tailwind integration plugin for Vite

## Routing

- `react-router-dom` — client-side routing library
- `BrowserRouter` — currently used router wrapper in `App.jsx`
- `createBrowserRouter` / `RouterProvider` — present in commented code as intended routing setup

## Icons

- `lucide-react` — icon library used in `ContactUs.jsx`

## Linting and Code Quality

- `eslint` — linting engine
- `@eslint/js` — ESLint config for JavaScript
- `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` — React hooks lint rules
- `eslint-plugin-react-refresh` — React refresh lint rules
- `globals` — global variable definitions used by ESLint

## Vite & React Integration

- `@vitejs/plugin-react` — Vite plugin for React support

## Type Support

- `@types/react` — type definitions for React
- `@types/react-dom` — type definitions for React DOM

## Package Scripts

- `npm run dev` — start Vite development server
- `npm run build` — create production build
- `npm run preview` — preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint across the project

## Notes on Tool Usage

- The repo uses ES module mode via `type: "module"` in `package.json`.
- Tailwind classes are applied directly in JSX, so the tool chain depends on the CSS build pipeline in `vite.config.js` and Tailwind configuration.
- React Router links are already used, even though the route configuration is not fully enabled in current `App.jsx`.
- `Router` dependency in `package.json` looks unusual and may be unused; likely a stray or incorrect package entry.
